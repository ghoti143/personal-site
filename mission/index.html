study, and life-giving experiences with the true, the good, and the beautiful.</i></p><h1>Life in the Church</h1><p>True human flourishing cannot be understood apart from life in the Church: the Body of Christ. The primary need of every young man is to come to Christ in baptism and faith, and to spend the rest of his life “growing in the knowledge and love of God” (2 Peter 3:18). The final cause of a properly understood classical education, the end and purpose, is the growth of piety, “the proper love and fear of God and man” (Clark and Jain 18). This happens in many ways, and all of education should be oriented toward and around this unifying purpose.</p><p>To this end, the center of the school will be the Church. The boys will begin to learn that the Church is their true home on earth because the Church will be the center of gravity at the school. The campus will be centered around the chapel. The school day will be tolled out by the church bell. Every class taught will be connected and integrated to the teachings of the Church and her doctors. The pattern of life will teach them, quietly yet surely, hour by hour, that “The world is charged with the grandeur of God.”</p><p>The model for this type of school is essentially Benedictine. “Ora et Labora,” prayer and work, will guide and organize each day at the school. The boys will be immersed in the Holy Scriptures daily in the services of the Church: the Mass and Morning and Evening Prayer, as well as in the boys’ private devotions. They will learn to “pray without ceasing” by practicing throughout the day in light of the Church’s ancient wisdom. As they cultivate their capacity for prayer and attention, the boys will also learn the value of good work. Bee keeping, farming, caring for livestock, crafting new buildings on campus, repairing fences, and various other experiences of meaningful, hard work will help impart a sense of accomplishment, capability, and craftsmanship to the students.</p><p>The chaplain of the school, appointed by the bishop, will guide and direct the program in conjunction with the administrators of the school and the board of advisors. The latter of which will be invited to serve the school apart from the requirement of financial donation. The school’s direction will come from the Church and the best philosophers of education in the country.</p><p>This school will be under the jurisdiction of the Anglican Province of America, and will be part of the Diocese of the Eastern United States (DEUS). The priest of the mission church will be sent by the bishop.</p><h1>A Classical Curriculum</h1><p>If the boys at the school are going to learn to love the Lord with all their mind, they need to read what Matthew Arnold called “the best of what’s been thought and said.” Their studies will be rooted in the Western tradition of education. They will study the seven Liberal Arts, Philosophy, and Theology. These will be their primary academic courses, and they will be rigorous, which means they will demand that the boys pour their hearts and minds joyfully into their studies. The boys will be called on to read, write, memorize, recite, debate, and continually discuss the greatest works of the Western Past.</p><p>This means that the Holy Scriptures and the teachings of the Ancient Greeks will provide the boys with a rich introduction to humanity’s perennial questions. Rather than a shallow and wide attempt at studying all cultures for all times, the boys will gain a rich awareness of the classical past by reading the Great Works of the Western tradition. They will engage in “authentic peripheral participation”—real practices of scholars—instead of thin and uninspiring imitations.</p><p>The boys at this school will be given a thorough introduction to the heritage of poetry and literature in English. They will become acquainted with the variety and richness their mother tongue has to offer by steeping themselves in the language and stories of the masters. They will learn eloquence through imitation, and the craft of beautiful writing through regular practice.</p><p>Instead of introductory textbooks, which tend to flatten the past and subject the readers to slothfully constructed sterility of style, the students at the school will engage with the best primary sources from the classical past. For philosophy they will read Plato’s Republic and Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics. Euclid’s Elements will provide their introduction to geometry and mathematical thinking. Instead of an overview of the Greek world gleaned from the chaff of cynical secondary sources, they will read Herodotus’ Histories and Thucydides’ History of the Peloponnesian Wars, and hear the past come to life as they learn to listen to these primary sources and understand the world in which they were written.</p><p>As their instructors take them through these time-tested works, they will open the boys’ eyes to the wonder of God’s created order, and usher them into the Great Conversation. They will also be learning the practices of real historians, real mathematicians, real philosophers, and will themselves become apprentices to these great minds. The boys will get their education from the sources rather than downstream through many filters. Education has worked this way before. In the right hands, with the proper zeal and structure, it can work this way again.</p><h1>Life-Giving Experiences with the Good, True, and Beautiful</h1><p>Augustine said that “God has two books,” and he was referring to The Holy Scriptures and the created order. Contemporary culture cuts boys off from both. With the scriptures relegated to the private sphere, boys who go through the public schools will rarely (if ever) “read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest” the living and active word of God.</p><p>The other book is also proscribed, not by legislation, but by cultural habit. The average teenager’s day is mediated by the media blitz: hours of enticing videos, electronically delivered music, social media, emails, television, texts, and the general inwardness of climate controlled living. As Sven Birkerts put it, “A finely filamented electronic scrim has slipped between ourselves and the so-called ‘outside world’” resulting in a condition of ‘almost unbroken mediation.’<sup>[1]</sup></p><p>It would be easy to go through the day without looking at a single flower, tree branch, bird, river, or sunset. Boys raised in this environment will graduate their high schools having been exposed to much (probably too much), but will be largely ignorant of both of God’s books.</p><p>If we want to awaken boys to the wonder of life and the wisdom of the past, they will need to be ushered into a different pattern of life and richer modes of learning that give them a less mediated experience of the cosmos. Their entire selves—spirit, soul, and body—need to come into contact with what Daniel Kerr calls “the sharp edges of reality.”</p><p>“All poetry begins in delight and ends in wonder,” said John Senior. The poetic mode of teaching and learning will be the primary means of cultivating the right affections in young men. This means that all of their senses must be engaged in the pursuit of truth. They should gaze at the stars, listen to great poems recited, smell the incense rising in church, feast together on the fruits of the earth and their hard labor, and learn the feeling of a dozen worthwhile crafts.</p><p>Such poetic knowledge will help the boys read both of God’s books. A school organized around the poetic mode of teaching and learning will make the entire day, from the morning’s chores to sung compline, a rich array of encounters with the good, true, and beautiful.</p><p><sup>[1]</sup> Sven Birkerts, The Gutenberg Elegies: The Fate of Reading in an Electronic Age (Faber and Faber, 1994), 5.</p></article></div><section id="sidebar"><section id="intro"><a href="/" class="logo"><img alt="" src="/images/st-dunstan.jpg"></a><header><h2>St. Dunstan’s Academy</h2><p>Vitam Abuntantius Habere</p></header></section><section class="blurb"><h2>About</h2><p>A boys’ boarding school in the country, centered around a parish mission church, operating as a small village with a functioning farm...</p><ul class="actions"><li><a href="/prospectus" class="button">Learn More</a></li></ul></section><section id="footer"><p class="copyright">© St. Dunstan’s Academy <a href="/">stdunstansacademy.com</a>.</p></section></section></div></div><script src="https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js" async></script><script>!function(e){function t(t){for(var n,u,i=t[0],c=t[1],s=t[2],f=0,p=[];f<i.length;f++)u=i[f],Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(o,u)&&o[u]&&p.push(o[u][0]),o[u]=0;for(n in c)Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(c,n)&&(e[n]=c[n]);for(l&&l(t);p.length;)p.shift()();return a.push.apply(a,s||[]),r()}function r(){for(var e,t=0;t<a.length;t++){for(var r=a[t],n=!0,i=1;i<r.length;i++){var c=r[i];0!==o[c]&&(n=!1)}n&&(a.splice(t--,1),e=u(u.s=r[0]))}return e}var n={},o={1:0},a=[];function u(t){if(n[t])return n[t].exports;var r=n[t]={i:t,l:!1,exports:{}};return e[t].call(r.exports,r,r.exports,u),r.l=!0,r.exports}u.e=function(e){var t=[],r=o[e];if(0!==r)if(r)t.push(r[2]);else{var n=new Promise((function(t,n){r=o[e]=[t,n]}));t.push(r[2]=n);var a,i=document.createElement("script");i.charset="utf-8",i.timeout=120,u.nc&&i.setAttribute("nonce",u.nc),i.src=function(e){return u.p+"static/js/"+({}[e]||e)+"."+{3:"f8a54183",4:"039e7e79",5:"68a2048d",6:"0cf150db",7:"8a4bbd73",8:"338732e6"}[e]+".chunk.js"}(e);var c=new Error;a=function(t){i.onerror=i.onload=null,clearTimeout(s);var r=o[e];if(0!==r){if(r){var n=t&&("load"===t.type?"missing":t.type),a=t&&t.target&&t.target.src;c.message="Loading chunk "+e+" failed.\n("+n+": "+a+")",c.name="ChunkLoadError",c.type=n,c.request=a,r[1](c)}o[e]=void 0}};var s=setTimeout((function(){a({type:"timeout",target:i})}),12e4);i.onerror=i.onload=a,document.head.appendChild(i)}return Promise.all(t)},u.m=e,u.c=n,u.d=function(e,t,r){u.o(e,t)||Object.defineProperty(e,t,{enumerable:!0,get:r})},u.r=function(e){"undefined"!=typeof Symbol&&Symbol.toStringTag&&Object.defineProperty(e,Symbol.toStringTag,{value:"Module"}),Object.defineProperty(e,"__esModule",{value:!0})},u.t=function(e,t){if(1&t&&(e=u(e)),8&t)return e;if(4&t&&"object"==typeof e&&e&&e.__esModule)return e;var r=Object.create(null);if(u.r(r),Object.defineProperty(r,"default",{enumerable:!0,value:e}),2&t&&"string"!=typeof e)for(var n in e)u.d(r,n,function(t){return e[t]}.bind(null,n));return r},u.n=function(e){var t=e&&e.__esModule?function(){return e.default}:function(){return e};return u.d(t,"a",t),t},u.o=function(e,t){return Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(e,t)},u.p="/",u.oe=function(e){throw console.error(e),e};var i=this.webpackJsonpstdunstansacademy=this.webpackJsonpstdunstansacademy||[],c=i.push.bind(i);i.push=t,i=i.slice();for(var s=0;s<i.length;s++)t(i[s]);var l=c;r()}([])</script><script src="/static/js/2.d3f0cebb.chunk.js"></script><script src="/static/js/main.037325db.chunk.js"></script></body></html>

The final cause of a properly understood classical education, the end and purpose, is the growth of piety, \u201cthe proper love and fear of God and man\u201d (Clark and Jain 18). This happens in many ways, and all of education should be oriented toward and around this unifying purpose."}),Object(r.jsx)("p",{children:"To this end, the center of the school will be the Church. The boys will begin to learn that the Church is their true home on earth because the Church will be the center of gravity at the school. The campus will be centered around the chapel.

They will study the seven Liberal Arts, Philosophy, and Theology.

Instead of an overview of the Greek world gleaned from the chaff of cynical secondary sources, they will read Herodotus\u2019 Histories and Thucydides\u2019 History of the Peloponnesian Wars, and hear the past come to life as they learn to listen to these primary sources and understand the world in which they were written."}),Object(r.jsx)("p",{children:"As their instructors take them through these time-tested works, they will open the boys\u2019 eyes to the wonder of God\u2019s created order, and usher them into the Great Conversation.

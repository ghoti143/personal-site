          To raise up godly men, formed by life in the Church, a classical curriculum of study, and
          life-giving experiences with the true, the good, and the beautiful.

      <h1>Life in the Church</h1>
      <p>
        True human flourishing cannot be understood apart from life in the Church: the Body of
        Christ. The primary need of every young man is to come to Christ in baptism and faith, and
        to spend the rest of his life “growing in the knowledge and love of God” (2 Peter 3:18). The
        final cause of a properly understood classical education, the end and purpose, is the growth
        of piety, “the proper love and fear of God and man” (Clark and Jain 18). This happens in
        many ways, and all of education should be oriented toward and around this unifying purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        To this end, the center of the school will be the Church. The boys will begin to learn that
        the Church is their true home on earth because the Church will be the center of gravity at
        the school. The campus will be centered around the chapel. The school day will be tolled out
        by the church bell. Every class taught will be connected and integrated to the teachings of
        the Church and her doctors. The pattern of life will teach them, quietly yet surely, hour by
        hour, that “The world is charged with the grandeur of God.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The model for this type of school is essentially Benedictine. “Ora et Labora,” prayer and
        work, will guide and organize each day at the school. The boys will be immersed in the Holy
        Scriptures daily in the services of the Church: the Mass and Morning and Evening Prayer, as
        well as in the boys’ private devotions. They will learn to “pray without ceasing” by
        practicing throughout the day in light of the Church’s ancient wisdom. As they cultivate
        their capacity for prayer and attention, the boys will also learn the value of good work.
        Bee keeping, farming, caring for livestock, crafting new buildings on campus, repairing
        fences, and various other experiences of meaningful, hard work will help impart a sense of
        accomplishment, capability, and craftsmanship to the students.
      </p>
      <p>
        The chaplain of the school, appointed by the bishop, will guide and direct the program in
        conjunction with the administrators of the school and the board of advisors. The latter of
        which will be invited to serve the school apart from the requirement of financial donation.
        The school’s direction will come from the Church and the best philosophers of education in
        the country.
      </p>
      <p>
        This school will be under the jurisdiction of the Anglican Province of America, and will be
        part of the Diocese of the Eastern United States (DEUS). The priest of the mission church
        will be sent by the bishop.
      </p>
      <h1>A Classical Curriculum</h1>
      <p>
        If the boys at the school are going to learn to love the Lord with all their mind, they need
        to read what Matthew Arnold called “the best of what’s been thought and said.” Their studies
        will be rooted in the Western tradition of education. They will study the seven Liberal
        Arts, Philosophy, and Theology. These will be their primary academic courses, and they will
        be rigorous, which means they will demand that the boys pour their hearts and minds joyfully
        into their studies. The boys will be called on to read, write, memorize, recite, debate, and
        continually discuss the greatest works of the Western Past.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that the Holy Scriptures and the teachings of the Ancient Greeks will provide the
        boys with a rich introduction to humanity’s perennial questions. Rather than a shallow and
        wide attempt at studying all cultures for all times, the boys will gain a rich awareness of
        the classical past by reading the Great Works of the Western tradition. They will engage in
        “authentic peripheral participation”&mdash;real practices of scholars&mdash;instead of thin
        and uninspiring imitations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The boys at this school will be given a thorough introduction to the heritage of poetry and
        literature in English. They will become acquainted with the variety and richness their
        mother tongue has to offer by steeping themselves in the language and stories of the
        masters. They will learn eloquence through imitation, and the craft of beautiful writing
        through regular practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of introductory textbooks, which tend to flatten the past and subject the readers to
        slothfully constructed sterility of style, the students at the school will engage with the
        best primary sources from the classical past. For philosophy they will read Plato’s Republic
        and Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics. Euclid’s Elements will provide their introduction to
        geometry and mathematical thinking. Instead of an overview of the Greek world gleaned from
        the chaff of cynical secondary sources, they will read Herodotus’ Histories and Thucydides’
        History of the Peloponnesian Wars, and hear the past come to life as they learn to listen to
        these primary sources and understand the world in which they were written.
      </p>
      <p>
        As their instructors take them through these time-tested works, they will open the boys’
        eyes to the wonder of God’s created order, and usher them into the Great Conversation. They
        will also be learning the practices of real historians, real mathematicians, real
        philosophers, and will themselves become apprentices to these great minds. The boys will get
        their education from the sources rather than downstream through many filters. Education has
        worked this way before. In the right hands, with the proper zeal and structure, it can work
        this way again.
      </p>
      <h1>Life-Giving Experiences with the Good, True, and Beautiful</h1>
      <p>
        Augustine said that “God has two books,” and he was referring to The Holy Scriptures and the
        created order. Contemporary culture cuts boys off from both. With the scriptures relegated
        to the private sphere, boys who go through the public schools will rarely (if ever) “read,
        mark, learn, and inwardly digest” the living and active word of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other book is also proscribed, not by legislation, but by cultural habit. The average
        teenager’s day is mediated by the media blitz: hours of enticing videos, electronically
        delivered music, social media, emails, television, texts, and the general inwardness of
        climate controlled living. As Sven Birkerts put it, “A finely filamented electronic scrim
        has slipped between ourselves and the so-called ‘outside world’” resulting in a condition of
        ‘almost unbroken mediation.’<sup>[1]</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        It would be easy to go through the day without looking at a single flower, tree branch,
        bird, river, or sunset. Boys raised in this environment will graduate their high schools
        having been exposed to much (probably too much), but will be largely ignorant of both of
        God’s books.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we want to awaken boys to the wonder of life and the wisdom of the past, they will need
        to be ushered into a different pattern of life and richer modes of learning that give them a
        less mediated experience of the cosmos. Their entire selves&mdash;spirit, soul, and
        body&mdash;need to come into contact with what Daniel Kerr calls “the sharp edges of
        reality.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “All poetry begins in delight and ends in wonder,” said John Senior. The poetic mode of
        teaching and learning will be the primary means of cultivating the right affections in young
        men. This means that all of their senses must be engaged in the pursuit of truth. They
        should gaze at the stars, listen to great poems recited, smell the incense rising in church,
        feast together on the fruits of the earth and their hard labor, and learn the feeling of a
        dozen worthwhile crafts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such poetic knowledge will help the boys read both of God’s books. A school organized around
        the poetic mode of teaching and learning will make the entire day, from the morning’s chores
        to sung compline, a rich array of encounters with the good, true, and beautiful.

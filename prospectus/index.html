culture, which has long been indifferent to the Christian formation of young men, has grown hostile to the kind of training young people need if they are going to learn how to love God with all their heart, soul, mind, and strength, and to love their neighbors as themselves. Growing in wisdom and stature in the sight of God and man during the pivotal ages of 14-18 years old now requires significant and intentional detachment from the mainstream. Boys need separation from malforming influences and a culture full of indolence and waste. Socially, most of what they’ll learn from their peers when unsupervised is destructive. In terms of media exposure, most of what boys see online vacillates between the shallow and sordid, and riddles their imaginations with jitters, noise, and darkness.</p><p>And yet, though boys would benefit from relative seclusion from the mainstream, isolation isn’t enough. If they are going to leave boyhood behind and turn into men, they need a harmonious place to inhabit, full of opportunities and adventures. Young men also crave good company; they are socially motivated, and grow in power to love when surrounded by a band of brothers and godly mentors. It isn’t sufficient to remove pernicious influences from their midst. They need to “stuff their eyes with wonder” at God’s created order, and begin practicing all the good habits they’ll need to be good men living with integrity in a crooked world.</p><p>The best solution to this dilemma is to provide them with a school culture set apart from the noise, enticing glare, and shallowness of contemporary culture, yet full of all the good cultural soil they need to flourish.</p><p><i>A boys’ boarding school in the country, centered around a parish mission church, operating as a small village with a functioning farm, would provide boys with myriad opportunities to practice living the life to which God has called them.</i></p><p>The day’s schedule would be tolled out by the church bell, not alarms on a phone or PA system. Morning prayers, said early by the whole school, would set the devotional tone needed to consecrate all the day’s work to God.</p><p>Because they have land to move through and cultivate, the boys will discover the good of growing much of their own food. Their morning chores will bring them into glorious, strenuous contact with the reality of God’s created order. Milking cows, gathering eggs, planting vegetables, cooking food for their brothers, and cleaning the bathrooms together, will impart humble and hearty strength and gratitude for the many gifts of life.</p><p>After chores and breakfast, classes will operate the way boys have long dreamed. Under the wise direction of teachers deeply invested in the boys’ whole formation, not just their intellectual growth, the boys will listen, recite, debate, read, and write in the varied and inspiring locations a country boarding school with a large property allows. Sometimes they will listen to a lecture under the hand-hewn beams of the timber-framed Great Hall. Other times, when they need to spar in honest and cheerful debate, they will gather in a room handsomely-shelved with good and great books. The entire campus will offer places for group discussion and personal reflection. The boys might read Plato around the fire outside, or get their theology lesson from the priest walking them through the chapel and pointing out the architecture of the church, or learn to identify every tree on campus by sketching and water-coloring with their natural sciences instructor.</p><p>But the most significant portion of their formation will take place at the Mass. The boys will learn to worship and to pray—their two greatest needs—and gain the freedom that wells up into songs of praise. Their hearts will grow with their voices, and their attention spans will deepen and intensify as they gradually come to control their thoughts and reflections. They will worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness while they learn to center their lives, like their schedules, around the altar.</p><p>Part of the beauty of this model is the sheer amount of time available at a boarding school to expose boys to the many studies needed in order to become good men.</p><p>In the time they recuperate from screens, the competitive sports frenzy, and hours trapped indoors, the boys will receive a top-notch classical education. Crucially, their Christian formation will not end when the academic day resolves. Their time outside of the classroom will also be marked by rich and beautiful endeavors. They will learn to live a full life.</p><p>After a hearty lunch, the boys will don their uniforms and head to the fields for feats of athletic prowess—either soccer, or rugby, or a run through the school’s obstacle course. “Mens sana in corpore sana,” a sound mind in a sound body, was the ancient ideal, and the day will include plenty of gymnastic education, which boys crave, and which will connect their bodies and souls more fully to what they study.</p><p>There will be no varsity sports to suck away the boys’ time in travel and unbalanced obsession. But there will be daily intramural competition for boys to throw themselves into joyously and headlong, picking up bruises and badges of honor in the company of the platoon.</p><p>And all the while, they will sing. They will learn the great songs of the past, both church anthems and sturdy folk songs, and take up instruments to make them ring out on campus. Every boy will play music.</p><p>The reason they will sing is because their hearts will be full. They will want to sing, especially once they learn the songs which celebrate the fullness, beauty, and wonder of life. But they will also make music together because otherwise they won’t have it. Music teaches harmony and love to the soul, and these are the prerequisite for piety and faithfulness. Musical education will be woven throughout the day, but it will require the boys to become proficient musicians.</p><p>The boys will practice technological poverty—life without cell phones, ipods, cameras, or computers. Freed from the enticing, addicting, and distracting media that saturates our culture from the breakfast-table onward, the boys will have time to learn 100 wonderful things they otherwise wouldn’t have time for: how to carve a mortise and tenon joint, how to play the piano, where deer are likely to wander in a particular grove of trees during hunting season, which constellations are visible in September, what it feels like to recite a beautiful and rousing poem, how to start a fire outside on a rainy day, the sensation of tackling and being tackled, how to plant a garden thoughtfully, or when the fish are most likely to bite.</p><p>Their days will end in contentment, because they will be tired, they will have accomplished much, and the bells that ring out the call to evening prayer will allow them to rest. After evening chores, the boys will gather to hear great stories read aloud, to write poems of their own, to play the songs of evening time, to chant the Psalms of compline, to face one another on the chess board or ping-pong table, to compose a long and beautifully penned letter to their family or the girl they hope to take out for a walk in the first cool evening of the summer term back home.</p><p>Through all of this, they will learn that life is an adventure, their own days are a pilgrimage, and theirs is a joyful battle for the Kingdom of God in which they are called to take up arms and quit themselves like men.</p><p>In short, this village-farm-monastery-school would give boys the experiences and rites of passage they need to become godly men. Instead of a disenchanted world, they will find theirs “charged with the grandeur of God,” glimmering with splendor and calling out for response.</p></article></div><section id="sidebar"><section id="intro"><a href="/" class="logo"><img alt="" src="/images/st-dunstan.jpg"></a><header><h2>St. Dunstan’s Academy</h2><p>Vitam Abuntantius Habere</p></header></section><section class="blurb"><h2>About</h2><p>A boys’ boarding school in the country, centered around a parish mission church, operating as a small village with a functioning farm...</p><ul class="actions"><li><a href="/prospectus" class="button">Learn More</a></li></ul></section><section id="footer"><p class="copyright">© St. Dunstan’s Academy <a href="/">stdunstansacademy.com</a>.</p></section></section></div></div><script src="https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js" async></script><script>!function(e){function t(t){for(var n,u,i=t[0],c=t[1],s=t[2],f=0,p=[];f<i.length;f++)u=i[f],Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(o,u)&&o[u]&&p.push(o[u][0]),o[u]=0;for(n in c)Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(c,n)&&(e[n]=c[n]);for(l&&l(t);p.length;)p.shift()();return a.push.apply(a,s||[]),r()}function r(){for(var e,t=0;t<a.length;t++){for(var r=a[t],n=!0,i=1;i<r.length;i++){var c=r[i];0!==o[c]&&(n=!1)}n&&(a.splice(t--,1),e=u(u.s=r[0]))}return e}var n={},o={1:0},a=[];function u(t){if(n[t])return n[t].exports;var r=n[t]={i:t,l:!1,exports:{}};return e[t].call(r.exports,r,r.exports,u),r.l=!0,r.exports}u.e=function(e){var t=[],r=o[e];if(0!==r)if(r)t.push(r[2]);else{var n=new Promise((function(t,n){r=o[e]=[t,n]}));t.push(r[2]=n);var a,i=document.createElement("script");i.charset="utf-8",i.timeout=120,u.nc&&i.setAttribute("nonce",u.nc),i.src=function(e){return u.p+"static/js/"+({}[e]||e)+"."+{3:"f8a54183",4:"039e7e79",5:"68a2048d",6:"0cf150db",7:"8a4bbd73",8:"338732e6"}[e]+".chunk.js"}(e);var c=new Error;a=function(t){i.onerror=i.onload=null,clearTimeout(s);var r=o[e];if(0!==r){if(r){var n=t&&("load"===t.type?"missing":t.type),a=t&&t.target&&t.target.src;c.message="Loading chunk "+e+" failed.\n("+n+": "+a+")",c.name="ChunkLoadError",c.type=n,c.request=a,r[1](c)}o[e]=void 0}};var s=setTimeout((function(){a({type:"timeout",target:i})}),12e4);i.onerror=i.onload=a,document.head.appendChild(i)}return Promise.all(t)},u.m=e,u.c=n,u.d=function(e,t,r){u.o(e,t)||Object.defineProperty(e,t,{enumerable:!0,get:r})},u.r=function(e){"undefined"!=typeof Symbol&&Symbol.toStringTag&&Object.defineProperty(e,Symbol.toStringTag,{value:"Module"}),Object.defineProperty(e,"__esModule",{value:!0})},u.t=function(e,t){if(1&t&&(e=u(e)),8&t)return e;if(4&t&&"object"==typeof e&&e&&e.__esModule)return e;var r=Object.create(null);if(u.r(r),Object.defineProperty(r,"default",{enumerable:!0,value:e}),2&t&&"string"!=typeof e)for(var n in e)u.d(r,n,function(t){return e[t]}.bind(null,n));return r},u.n=function(e){var t=e&&e.__esModule?function(){return e.default}:function(){return e};return u.d(t,"a",t),t},u.o=function(e,t){return Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(e,t)},u.p="/",u.oe=function(e){throw console.error(e),e};var i=this.webpackJsonpstdunstansacademy=this.webpackJsonpstdunstansacademy||[],c=i.push.bind(i);i.push=t,i=i.slice();for(var s=0;s<i.length;s++)t(i[s]);var l=c;r()}([])</script><script src="/static/js/2.d3f0cebb.chunk.js"></script><script src="/static/js/main.037325db.chunk.js"></script></body></html>
